# built-by-gpt

A small multi-language scaffold for experimenting with tiny apps generated by tools.

This repository contains starter folders for different languages. Each folder has a minimal "basic_app" you can run and extend.

Repository layout

- `python/basic_app/`
	- `src/main.py` — minimal Python CLI that prints a greeting
	- `tests/test_main.py` — tiny smoke test
	- `requirements.txt`
	- `README.md` — how to run the Python app
- `node/basic_app/`
	- `src/index.js` — simple Node script
	- `package.json`
- `go/basic_app/`
	- `main.go` — simple Go program
- `java/basic_app/`
	- `src/Main.java` — simple Java program

How to try the Python app

Run the Python script (macOS / Linux):

```bash
python3 python/basic_app/src/main.py --name Karim

How to try the Python app

Run the Python script (macOS / Linux):

```bash
python3 python/basic_app/src/main.py --name Karim
```

You can also run the quick test (if you have pytest installed):

```bash
cd python/basic_app
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt  # optional
python3 -m pytest -q
```

Other quick-run examples

Go:
```bash
go run go/basic_app/main.go
```

Java (javac + java):
```bash
javac java/basic_app/src/Main.java -d java/basic_app/out
java -cp java/basic_app/out Main
```

If you'd like, I can add more languages, CI, or templates for production projects. Happy to expand any of the stubs.
